## Face-recognition-from-video-frames-or-webcam

This is an OpenCV based face recognition software.
A Haar Cascade is a classifier which is used to detect the object for which it has been trained for, from the source. The Haar Cascade is trained by superimposing the positive image over a set of negative images. This code makes use of the pre trained default face and eye cascade xml files to detect faces. 

## Dependencies
Python 3.0


OpenCV
